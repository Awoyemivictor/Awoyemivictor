Full Stack Blockchain and Entrepreneur by day...Teacher, Mentor and Coach by night! I combine my two greatest passions and I apply them to bridge the gap between technology and business goals.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#
My name is Awoyemi Victor, and I began my career as a Software Engineer in 2017 while working as a freelancer on the other side. My passion involve using innovations and techonologies to find creative innovative solutions and simplified ideas. My programming skills include: C, C++/SDL2, Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL Databases, SQLAlchemy and FastAPI; developing various software applications ranging from Web app, Games & Blockchains. My deep passion in coding led me to learning HTML & CSS from scratch back in 2017 using various tools and resources available to me at that time.
#
I specialize in Blockchain developments with main focus on Ethereum only. I can handle any sort of Blockchain related projects ranging from Smart Contracts, Crypto token creation, NFTs Minting Website and Marketplace, Dapps, ICO and many more.
#
Within me is a deep voice ready to learn more and solve real life problems with my coding skills. My expectations for the future is high and I storngly believe the world is waiting to hear that deep roaring within me. Some of my past projects are available on my repositories. You can as well check them out.
