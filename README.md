Programming and Coding can be boring... frustrating... and devastating... 🙁 Yeah, I know and I've also been in that shoe and that's why am here to help you.

### Hi there 👋

#
I’m Awoyemi Victor, a Full-Stack Solana Blockchain & Web Developer,  Teacher, Trainer and Coach.
#
When I started coding, I struggled. I landed an internship web3 related job, but I didn’t know how to go about it. I turned to countless courses and books, but they only taught theory.
#
Nothing helped. Gosh! 🥹 The courses left me confused, bored, demotivated, and helpless. They taught concepts…but none of them taught me how to use those concepts to make something real.

Many days I was unable to write even a single line of code. I was so close to giving up but my love for coding was the only thing that kept me going.

After a lot of trial and error and unending frustration, I finally discovered the best way to learn and impact others. You want to know the answer?
