Let me quickly introduce myselfðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#
My name is Awoyemi Victor, and I began my career as a Software Engineer in 2017 while working as a freelancer on the side. My deep passion in coding led me to learning HTML & CSS for start using various tools and resources available to me at that time.
#
After some time, I spent two years to learn Frontend Web Application design with CMS platforms like WordPress, Wix & Shopify at the same time, receiving various jobs from clients all across the world. Because I was hungry for more, my drive led me to apply to study as a full-time Software Engineer in the ALX Software Engineering Programme and I joined the Cohort 8 back in June 2022. So far, I have been learning low level programming languages, ranging from C to Python. I also build front-end application and interface with React.Js, JavaScript & TypeScript.
#
Within me is a deep voice ready that is eager to know more and solve real life problems with my programming knowledge drive. My expectations for the future is high and I storngly believe the world is waiting to hear that deep roaring within me. Some of my past projects are available on my repositories. You can as well check them out.
