### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Awoyemi Victor, and I began my career as a web developer in the middle of 2020 while working as a freelancer on the side. I began studying blockchain development in July 2021, focusing on the niche of developing NFTs and crypto tokens on the Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, and Tron Network.
#
Since July 2022, as a Software Engineer in the ALX Cohort 8 Program, I have been learning low level programming languages, ranging from C to Python.
#
I currently work as a part-time freelance developer exclusively on Upwork. You can check through my repositories to see projects which I've been able to work on and contribute to both as a student and also as a programmer.

I would love if you could buy me a Cup of Coffee if you find any of my repository projects helpful ðŸ˜Š: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/awoyemivictor
