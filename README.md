Content creator by day...Developer and Programmer by night! I combine my two greatest passions and I apply them to help you take advantage of Web3 technology, asset tokenization, Crypto tokens, NFT Minting website & Marketplace. Let me introduce myselfðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#
My name is Awoyemi Victor, and I began my career as a web developer in the middle of 2020 while working as a freelancer on the side. My deep passion led me to began studying blockchain development in July 2021, focusing on the niche of developing NFT Minting Website & Marketplace and not excluding Crypto tokens creations and Smart Contracts on the Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, and Tron Network.
#
I've also had to foster my knowledge as a Software Engineer and Developer since July 2022 studying in the ALX Cohort 8 Program. So far, I have been learning low level programming languages, ranging from C to Python. I also build front-end application and interface with React.Js, JavaScript & TypeScript.
#
I currently work as a part-time freelance developer exclusively on Upwork. You can check through my repositories to see projects which I've been able to work on and contribute to both as a student and also as a programmer.

I would love if you could buy me a Cup of Coffee if you find any of my repository projects helpful ðŸ˜Š: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/awoyemivictor
